# align-content
This aligns a flex containerâ€™s lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis.

```
    .parent {
        display: flex;
        flex-flow: row wrap;
        justify-content: flex-start;
        align-items: stretch;
        align-content: flex-start;
    }
```

```
    .parent {
        display: flex;
        flex-flow: row wrap;
        justify-content: flex-start;
        align-items: stretch;
        align-content: flex-end;
    }
```

```
    .parent {
        display: flex;
        flex-flow: row wrap;
        justify-content: flex-start;
        align-items: stretch;
        align-content: center;
    }
```

```
    .parent {
        display: flex;
        flex-flow: row wrap;
        justify-content: flex-start;
        align-items: stretch;
        align-content: space-between;
    }
```

```
    .parent {
        display: flex;
        flex-flow: row wrap;
        justify-content: flex-start;
        align-items: stretch;
        align-content: space-around;
    }
```

```
    .parent {
        display: flex;
        flex-flow: row wrap;
        justify-content: flex-start;
        align-items: stretch;
        align-content: space-evenly;
    }
```

```
    .parent {
        display: flex;
        flex-flow: row wrap;
        justify-content: flex-start;
        align-items: stretch;
        align-content: stretch;
    }
```

* normal (default): items are packed in their default position as if no value was set.
* flex-start / start: items packed to the start of the container. The (more supported) flex-start honors the flex-direction while start honors the writing-mode direction.
* flex-end / end: items packed to the end of the container. The (more support) flex-end honors the flex-direction while end honors the writing-mode direction.
* center: items centered in the container
* space-between: items evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the container while the last one is at the end
* space-around: items evenly distributed with equal space around each line
* space-evenly: items are evenly distributed with equal space around them
* stretch: lines stretch to take up the remaining space
